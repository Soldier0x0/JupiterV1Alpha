The previous AI engineer successfully initiated Project Jupiter, a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The work trajectory began with an initial codebase exploration, identifying a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend. The AI engineer then addressed critical functionality: establishing admin login, fixing environment-specific issues (Node.js versions, , ), and configuring test OTPs. A significant part of the work involved a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, implementing a professional design system using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, unified layouts, and robust formatting/linting tools. The trajectory culminated in the development of an automated production deployment guide for Debian servers, emphasizing admin-controlled user creation with secure password policies, JWT integration, and the removal of development-only dependencies. The system is now production-ready, featuring a professional UI, secure authentication, and a developer-friendly architecture.

<product_requirements>
The user initially provided a full-stack application (Project Jupiter, a SIEM system) and requested an understanding of the codebase. Key requirements evolved throughout the conversation:
1.  **Initial Access & Testing (Explicit):**
    *   Fix admin login issues.
    *   Configure a test OTP for easier login during development.
2.  **Self-Hosting & Automated Deployment (Explicit):**
    *   Provide a guide for self-hosting on a Debian server with Cloudflare DNS, TLS, and Tunnels.
    *   Create an automated deployment script that checks existing installations, installs missing components, handles API keys (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, etc.) with visible rate limits, and allows future API additions.
    *   Configure database for user/password/email storage and authentication, including new user creation, privilege assignment, and permissions.
    *   Set  as the owner/super admin, with OTP linked to Outlook.
3.  **UI/UX Enhancement & Operational Hygiene (Explicit):**
    *   Make the app professional and consistent with a design system (color/typography/spacing tokens), unify components with shadcn/ui and lucide-react icons, fix layout/spacing, and clean up operations.
    *   Specific requirements included:
        *   Tailwind setup,  for fluid typography and base styles.
        *    for a unified layout (left sidebar + main content, 1200px max width, 12-column grid).
        *   Dashboard cleanup using shadcn  components with consistent headers and lucide icons.
        *   Add Prettier (with Tailwind plugin), ESLint, and git hooks (, ).
        *   Docker Compose hygiene: remove  field, add healthchecks and explicit dependencies.
        *   Create  template.
4.  **Production Readiness & Admin Control (Explicit):**
    *   Link frontend and backend for production deployment.
    *   Remove public account creation from the frontend; admin must create users with specified tenant ID, email, and permissions.
    *   New users should receive an email to set a secure password (min 10 chars, 1 capital, 1 small, 1 special, 1 numeric, safe special chars).
    *   Create an  file with  and  as admin credentials, a tenant ID, and email these details to .
    *   Integrate JWT token generation/storage for new users.
    *   Remove all  related dependencies and ensure a single-command dependency installation for Debian 13.
    *   Ensure Cloudflare tunnel compatibility (already installed).
    *   Facilitate easy modification and replacement of tool components for developers.

<current_work>
The immediate work prior to this summary was the comprehensive implementation of a Complete Admin-Controlled Jupiter SIEM System Ready! as per the user's detailed requirements in Chat Message 265.

This involved:
1.  **Backend Changes:**
    *   Creating  for streamlined production dependencies, explicitly removing  and commenting out AI/ML related packages.
    *   Introducing  and updating  (likely replacing or augmenting ) to handle admin-controlled user creation, JWT generation/storage, and secure password policies.
    *   Configuring an admin account  with password  and  (ID ).
    *   Setting up email-based onboarding for new users, including sending welcome emails to .
2.  **Frontend Changes:**
    *   Modifying  to align with the admin-only login flow.
    *   Removing public registration functionality from .
    *   Creating  to facilitate the secure password setting for new users, including real-time validation for complexity (min 10 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 safe special character).
3.  **Deployment Scripts:**
    *   Creating  to automate the entire production setup, including dependency installation, Docker configuration, and system hardening, ensuring Cloudflare tunnel compatibility and developer modifiability.
    *   Creating  specifically for Debian 13.

The system is now designed to be deployed on a Debian 13 server, accessible via  (Cloudflare tunnel), with a pre-configured admin account for managing users and tenants.
